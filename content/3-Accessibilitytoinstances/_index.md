This task introduces developers to OPEA components deployed on an Amazon EKS cluster, leveraging configurations available on AWS Marketplace. Participants will have access to the codebase, enabling them to explore how various services operate and interact within the system.

A key focus of this exercise is understanding the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. Developers will learn how to query websites or PDFs and retrieve precise, contextually relevant responses. By engaging with these components, they will gain hands-on experience with RAG’s integration of retrieval mechanisms and generative models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of generated information using OPEA.

Learning Objectives:
Develop familiarity with OPEA components running on Amazon EKS.
Gain a deep understanding of the RAG architecture, particularly in document-based retrieval.
Interact with the ChatQnA application to query and retrieve information, reinforcing knowledge of RAG’s capabilities in generating contextually accurate answers.
