This task represents a significant contribution to the ongoing development of OPEA, demonstrating how AWS integrations can further enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) performance. Participants will learn how to replace the default vector database with OpenSearch, leveraging its advanced search and retrieval capabilities. Through hands-on exercises, they will contribute to expanding OPEA’s use cases and optimizing its RAG pipelines with scalable, cloud-native solutions.

**Learning Objectives**
+ **Understand the Impact of OpenSearch Integration in OPEA**: Gain insight into how replacing the vector database with OpenSearch enhances the platform’s capabilities and drives broader enterprise adoption.

+ **Implement OpenSearch in OPEA**: Develop hands-on expertise in integrating OpenSearch within the OPEA ecosystem to optimize search performance.

+ **Enhance Search and Retrieval Efficiency**: Explore how OpenSearch’s advanced capabilities can improve retrieval pipelines, leading to more effective RAG implementations.
